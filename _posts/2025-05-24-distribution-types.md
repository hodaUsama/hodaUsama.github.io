## üéØ <span style="color:#228B22; font-weight:bold;"> Population Distribution </span>

The **population distribution** describes the values of a variable for **all members** of a population.

- Mean: \\( \mu \\) (population mean)
- Standard deviation: \\( \sigma \\) (population standard deviation)

### Example:

Suppose the heights of all adults in a town are normally distributed with:

\\[
\mu = 170 \text{ cm}, \quad \sigma = 10 \text{ cm}
\\]

To find the probability that a randomly selected adult is taller than 180 cm, convert the score to a Z-score:

\\[
Z = \frac{180 - 170}{10} = 1
\\]

Then look up \\( P(Z > 1) \\) in the standard normal table (approximately 0.1587).

## üîç <span style="color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;"> Sample Distribution </span>

The **sample distribution** is the distribution of observed data values in a particular sample.

- Mean: \\( \bar{x} \\) (sample mean)
- Standard deviation: \\( s \\) (sample standard deviation)

### Example:

In a sample of 30 adults, you measure their heights and calculate:

\\[
\bar{x} = 168 \text{ cm}, \quad s = 11 \text{ cm}
\\]

To find the probability a randomly selected person in this sample is shorter than 160 cm:

\\[
Z = \frac{160 - 168}{11} \approx -0.73
\\]

Look up \\( P(Z < -0.73) \\) in the Z-table (about 0.2327).

## üìä <span style="color:#FFA500; font-weight:bold;"> Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean </span>

The **sampling distribution of the sample mean** is a **theoretical distribution** of all possible sample means from samples of size \\( n \\).

- Mean of sampling distribution: \\( \mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu \\)
- Standard error: \\( \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \\)

### Important:

- It is always approximately **normal**, regardless of the population distribution (by CLT).
- We standardize using Z-scores to calculate probabilities about sample means.

### Example:

From the previous population:

\\[
\mu = 170, \quad \sigma = 10, \quad n=25
\\]

The standard error is:

\\[
\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{25}} = 2
\\]

To find the probability that the sample mean is greater than 174 cm:

\\[
Z = \frac{174 - 170}{2} = 2
\\]

Look up \\( P(Z > 2) \\) (about 0.0228).
