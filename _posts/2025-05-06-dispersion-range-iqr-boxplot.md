Now that we’ve learned how to measure the **center** of data, let’s talk about how data **spreads out** — that’s called **dispersion**.

## 📏 <span style="color:#1E90FF;">Range: A Simple Start</span>

- **Range** = Largest value − Smallest value

\\[
\text{Range} = x_{\max} - x_{\min}
\\]

- Gives a basic idea of **spread**
- But it’s **not reliable** for measuring variability if there are **outliers**

💡 Example:  
If data = [5, 6, 6, 7, 95] →  
\\[
\text{Range} = 95 - 5 = 90
\\]

🛑 That huge gap is because of **one extreme value** (an outlier).

---

## 📦 <span style="color:#FFA500;">Interquartile Range (IQR)</span>

To handle outliers, we use the **IQR**, which is based on **quartiles**:

| Quartile | Meaning                         |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Q1       | 25% of data is below this point |
| Q2       | 50% (median)                   |
| Q3       | 75% of data is below this point |

### 🧮 Formula:

\\[
\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1
\\]

- IQR focuses on the **middle 50%** of the data
- It removes the influence of **extreme values**

💡 Example:

Given ordered data:  
[2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22]

- \( Q_1 = 5 \) (25th percentile)  
- \( Q_3 = 15 \) (75th percentile)

\\[
\text{IQR} = 15 - 5 = 10
\\]

This means the middle half of data spans 10 units.

## 📊 <span style="color:#20B2AA;">Box Plot: Best of Both Worlds</span>

A **box plot** visually summarizes:

- The **minimum** and **maximum** values (excluding outliers)
- **Q1, Q2 (median), and Q3**
- Any **outliers** (points beyond 1.5×IQR from quartiles)

It’s one of the best visual tools to understand:

- Center  
- Spread  
- Skewness  
- Outliers

---

## 🖼️ Visual: Anatomy of a Box Plot

![Box Plot Diagram](/assets/images/boxplot1.png)

- Each 25% of data is shown as a section  
- The box spans from Q1 to Q3  
- The line in the middle is the **median (Q2)**  
- Points outside the whiskers are **outliers**

---

## 🎯 Why Not Just Use the Mean?

While **central tendency** is important, it’s not enough.  
We need to know how **spread out** the data is — especially when comparing groups.

🧠 The **box plot** helps you see both center and variability.

  <div class="mt-2">
    <p>While the range gives a simple measure of spread, it’s very sensitive to outliers — extreme values can distort your understanding.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📊 The <strong>IQR</strong> zeroes in on the middle 50% of data, making it more robust when outliers exist.</li>
      <li>📦 The <strong>box plot</strong> visually separates the central bulk of data from outliers, showing you skewness and spread at a glance.</li>
      <li>🔍 These tools are especially important in fields like finance, biology, and machine learning where outliers are common.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mastering these measures will help you make better decisions and spot patterns that average measures alone can miss.</p>

## 🔁 <span style="color:#1E90FF;">Summary</span>

| Measure  | What it tells us             | Sensitive to outliers? |
|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Range    | Max − Min                   | ✅ Yes                |
| IQR      | Spread of middle 50%        | ❌ No                 |
| Box Plot | Visual of quartiles & outliers | ❌ No              |

Next, we’ll go deeper into **numeric measures** of variability:  
- **Variance**  
- **Standard Deviation**

And we’ll learn how to calculate and visualize them!

Stay tuned.
