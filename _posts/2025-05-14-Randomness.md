Ever flipped a coin and wondered why you got heads three times in a row? Welcome to the world of **randomness and probability** — where short-term surprises often give way to long-term patterns.

In this post, you'll explore what randomness really means, how we use **probability theory** to measure uncertainty, and how concepts like **sample space**, **mutual exclusivity**, and **tree diagrams** help us model real-world randomness — from games to machine learning.

## 🎲 <span style="color:#F06500;">What is Randomness?</span>

Randomness means outcomes vary in unpredictable ways — **in the short run**.

But here’s the twist:

> ✅ The more you repeat a random process, the more predictable the overall pattern becomes.

### Example:

- Flip a coin **5 times** → may get 3 heads, 2 tails  
- Flip it **5,000 times** → you'll get close to 50% heads

## 🔍 <span style="color:#1E90FF;">Measuring Randomness with Probability</span>

Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that describes the **likelihood** of an event.

\\[
0 < P(\text{event}) < 1
\\]

- 0 → impossible  
- 1 → certain  
- 0.5 → equal chance

For any complete experiment:

\\[
\sum P(\text{all possible events}) = 1
\\]

---

## 📈 <span style="color:#FFA500;">Relative Frequency & Cumulative Proportion</span>

When observing events over time, we can estimate probability with **relative frequency**:

\\[
P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{event count}}{\text{total trials}}
\\]

The **cumulative proportion** is the running total of relative frequencies as trials increase — a clearer picture of probability.

> 🧠 Over time, the cumulative proportion settles down and reflects the true likelihood.

## 🧪 <span style="color:#20B2AA;">Basic Terms You Must Know</span>

- **Experiment**: A repeatable process with uncertain outcome  
  _e.g. rolling a die_

- **Event**: A specific result or set of results  
  _e.g. rolling a 6, or getting an even number_

- **Independent Events**: The result of one doesn’t affect the other  
  _e.g. two separate coin tosses_

- **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes  
  _e.g. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for a die_

---

## 🌳 <span style="color:#9370DB;">Using Tree Diagrams to Visualize Outcomes</span>

Let’s say you toss a coin and then roll a die.

``` sql
       Start
        |
    -----------
   H           T
 / | \       / | \
1  2  3     1  2  3 ...

```

Each **branch** represents a possible compound outcome (e.g. H-2), and we can **multiply probabilities** along the paths.

---

## 🧩 <span style="color:#8A2BE2;">Event Types in Probability</span>

### Mutually Exclusive  
Events that **cannot happen at the same time**  
_Example: Rolling a 2 and a 5 in one roll_

\\[
P(A \cap B) = 0
\\]

### Collectively Exhaustive  
Events that together **cover all possibilities**  
\\[
\sum P(\text{events}) = 1
\\]

### Complement Event  
All outcomes **not** in the event  
\\[
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
\\]

---

### 🔗 Disjoint vs Independent

| Type | Description | Rule |
|------|-------------|------|
| Disjoint (Mutually Exclusive) | Events don’t overlap | \\( P(A \cap B) = 0 \\) |
| Independent | Events don’t affect each other | \\( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \\) |

---

## 🔍 <span style="color:#228B22;">Venn Diagram: Disjoint vs Overlapping</span>

![Randomness vs Stability](../assets/images/venn_disjoint_vs_independent.png)



- **Disjoint events** → no overlap  
- **Independent events** → can overlap, but still multiply their probabilities

## 🤖 Why This Matters in Machine Learning

Probability and randomness aren’t just academic ideas — they power real-world machine learning.

- Algorithms like Naive Bayes and Hidden Markov Models rely on **probabilistic logic**.
- Concepts like **independence** and **conditional probability** are fundamental in model design.
- Randomness underlies **cross-validation**, **bootstrapping**, and even **neural network weight initialization**.

Understanding these foundations helps you avoid black-box thinking — and build better models.
