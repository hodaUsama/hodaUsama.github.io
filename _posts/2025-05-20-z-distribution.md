## üìå <span style="color:#228B22; font-weight:bold;"> What is Z-Distribution? </span>

The Z-distribution (standard normal distribution) is a powerful tool in statistics and machine learning used to standardize values and compare scores across different datasets.
By converting raw data into z-scores, we can easily detect outliers, perform hypothesis testing, and interpret results on a common scale ‚Äî centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1.

## üî¢ <span style="color:#FFA500; font-weight:bold;">Why do we use Z-Distribution?</span>

If you want to find the probability or the space far from the mean by any value (like <span style="color:#D2691E;">1.3</span>), the Z-distribution helps by converting your values into a standardized form.

---

## üîÑ <span style="color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;"> Converting Between X and Z </span>

To work with any normal distribution, you first convert values \\( X \\) to their corresponding Z-scores:

\\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\\]

And vice versa:

\\[
X = Z \times \sigma + \mu
\\]

## üìä <span style="color:#8A2BE2; font-weight:bold;"> Understanding the Cumulative Z-Table </span>

The **Z-table** (or standard normal table) shows the cumulative probability for the standard normal distribution \\( Z \\).

- It gives the probability that a standard normal variable \\( Z \\) is **less than or equal to** a given value.
- In other words, it shows the area under the curve **to the left** of a Z-score.
- Values in the table range from 0 to 1 because they represent probabilities.

### How to Read the Z-Table

1. Find the **row** corresponding to the first two digits and the first decimal place of your Z-score.
2. Find the **column** corresponding to the second decimal place of your Z-score.
3. The value where the row and column intersect is the cumulative probability.

For example, to find the cumulative probability for \\( Z = 1.23 \\):
- Look at the row for <span style="color:#D2691E;">1.2</span>
- Look at the column for <span style="color:#D2691E;">0.03</span>
- The table value at this intersection is approximately <span style="color:#FF4500; font-weight:bold;">0.8907</span>

This means \\( P(Z \leq 1.23) = 0.8907 \\).

---

## üßÆ <span style="color:#2E8B57; font-weight:bold;"> Example: Using the Z-Table </span>

Suppose you want to find the probability that a standard normal variable \\( Z \\) is less than <span style="color:#D2691E;">1.23</span>.

- Locate <span style="color:#D2691E;">1.2</span> in the rows.
- Locate <span style="color:#D2691E;">0.03</span> in the columns.
- The value in the table is <span style="color:#FF4500; font-weight:bold;">0.8907</span>.

Thus, \\( P(Z \leq 1.23) = 0.8907 \\), meaning there is an **89.07% chance** that \\( Z \\) is less than or equal to 1.23.

---

## üîÑ <span style="color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;"> Summary of Using the Z-Table with Any Normal Distribution </span>

- First, convert your \\( X \\) value to a Z-score using:

\\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\\]

- Then, use the Z-table to find the cumulative probability for that Z.
- If you want the probability between two values, find the cumulative probabilities for both and subtract the smaller from the larger.

## üìä Visual Aid: Sample Z-Table (Partial)

| Z     | .00  | .01  | .02  | .03  | .04  |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1.2   | 0.8849 | 0.8869 | 0.8888 | <span style="color:#FF4500; font-weight:bold;">0.8907</span> | 0.8925 |
| 1.3   | 0.9032 | 0.9049 | 0.9066 | 0.9082 | 0.9099 |

*The value for Z=1.23 is highlighted.*

---

## üßÆ  <span style="color:#8A2BE2; font-weight:bold;"> Example: Finding Probability Between Two Values </span>

Suppose \\( X \\) is normally distributed with mean \\( \\mu = 3 \\) and standard deviation \\( \sigma = 1 \\). We want to find the probability that \\( X \\) lies between <span style="color:#D2691E;">2</span> and <span style="color:#D2691E;">5</span>.

### Step 1: Convert \\( X \\) values to Z-scores

\\[
Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}
\\]

Calculate:

 \\[
Z_1 = \\frac{2 - 3}{1} = -1
 \\]

\\[
Z_2 = \\frac{5 - 3}{1} = 2
\\]

### Step 2: Find cumulative probabilities using the Z-table

- The cumulative probability for \\( Z_2 = 2 \\) is approximately <span style="color:#FF4500; font-weight:bold;">0.9772</span>.
- The cumulative probability for \\( Z_1 = -1 \\) is approximately <span style="color:#FF4500; font-weight:bold;">0.1587</span>.

### Step 3: Subtract to get the probability between the two values
\\[
P(2 < X < 5) = P(Z < 2) - P(Z < -1) = 
\\]
<span style="color:#FF4500; font-weight:bold;">0.9772 - 0.1587 = 0.8185</span>


So, there is an approximately **81.85%** chance that \\( X \\) lies between 2 and 5.

### Visuals

Below are shaded regions representing these cumulative probabilities:

- Area below \\( X = 5 \\):

- Area below \\( X = 2 \\):

## üîü Example: 10th Percentile Duration

To find the 10th percentile, find the Z-score corresponding to 0.10 cumulative probability in the Z-table, then convert it back to \\( X \\):

\\[
X = Z_{0.10} \times \sigma + \mu
\\]

---

## üîÑ <span style="color:#228B22; font-weight:bold;"> Why Conversion Is Useful Beyond Normal Distributions </span>

Converting \\( X \\) to \\( Z \\) can be applied to various data types and distributions, not just normal ones. It standardizes data for easier comparison and probability calculations.

## ü§ñ Why It Matters for Machine Learning
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Z-scores</strong> are widely used to <strong>standardize features</strong> before feeding them into machine learning models like:
      <ul>
        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
        <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
        <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Z-distribution helps with <strong>outlier detection</strong> ‚Äî values with Z-scores beyond ¬±3 are often flagged as anomalies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Used in evaluating model performance with <strong>confidence intervals</strong> and <strong>hypothesis testing</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Important for techniques assuming normality (e.g., <strong>Linear Regression, Naive Bayes</strong>, and <strong>PCA</strong>).
