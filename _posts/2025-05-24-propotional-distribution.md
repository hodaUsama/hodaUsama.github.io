## 🎯 <span style="color:#228B22; font-weight:bold;"> The Sampling Distribution of the Sample Proportion </span>

In a **population**, the **proportion** is the number of successful outcomes over the total number of cases. This proportion is denoted by \\( \beta \\).

For a **sample**, the proportion is represented by \\( p \\), which is an estimate of \\( \beta \\) (population proportion). As the sample size increases, \\( p \\) gets closer to \\( \beta \\).

- **Number of samples** = \\( N \\)
- **Sample proportion** = \\( p \\)

## 🔍 <span style="color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold;"> Example: Proportion of Voters Supporting a Candidate </span>

Imagine you're conducting a poll to determine the proportion of voters supporting a political candidate in a city. Out of a sample of 1000 people:

- 600 people say they support the candidate, so the sample proportion \\( p = \frac{600}{1000} = 0.6 \\).

If you repeat this polling process many times, the **sample proportions** will vary. The more samples you take, the closer \\( p \\) will get to the\\( \beta \), which is the true support rate in the city.

## 📊 <span style="color:#FFA500; font-weight:bold;"> Key Properties of the Sampling Distribution of the Sample Proportion </span>

- As the number of samples approaches infinity, the **sample proportion \\( p \\)** will approximate the **population proportion \\( \beta \\)**.
- The **mean** of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is \\( \mu_p = \mu \\) (the population proportion).
- The sampling distribution is **approximately normal** if:
  - \\( n \times \beta \geq 15 \\)
  - \\( n \times (1 - \beta) \geq 15 \\)
  
This is because we are working with **binary categorical data**, where the outcomes are either "success" or "failure."

## 🔎 <span style="color:#2E8B57; font-weight:bold;"> Conditions for Normality </span>

- The **sampling distribution** of the sample proportion will be **approximately bell-shaped** if:
  - \\( n \times \beta \geq 15 \\)
  - \\( n \times (1 - \beta) \geq 15 \\)

Where:
- \\( n \\) = sample size
- \\( \beta \\) = population proportion (success rate)

This ensures that the data behaves like a normal distribution and we can use standard statistical tools like Z-scores.

## 📏 <span style="color:#8A2BE2; font-weight:bold;"> Standard Deviation of the Sample Proportion </span>

The standard deviation (also called the **standard error**) of the sample proportion is given by the formula:

\\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{\beta(1 - \beta)}{n}}
\\]

Where:
- \\( \beta \\) = population proportion
- \\( n \\) = sample size

### Example:
Let’s assume a population proportion of \\( \beta = 0.6 \\) (60% of people support a candidate), and you take a sample of size \\( n = 1000 \\).

The standard error is:

\\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{0.6(1 - 0.6)}{1000}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.24}{1000}} = 0.0155
\\]

This means the sample proportion will vary by about 0.0155 from the true population proportion on average.

## ⚖️ <span style="color:#DC143C; font-weight:bold;"> Calculating Proportions for Binary Categorical Variables </span>

When dealing with binary categorical variables (like success/failure, yes/no), **we don't need to calculate the mean or standard deviation** using traditional methods. Instead, we compute the **proportion \\( \beta \\)** for the population and \\( p \\) for the sample.

- **Population Proportion** \\( \beta \\)
- **Sample Proportion** \\( p \\)
- **Standard Deviation** of the sample proportion \\( \sigma_p \\)

### Example:

- Population: 60% support the candidate (\\( \beta = 0.6 \\))
- Sample: 550 out of 1000 support the candidate (\\( p = 0.55 \\))

Use the formula to find the standard error for further analysis.

      <li>The <b>Central Limit Theorem</b> ensures that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion becomes approximately normal, allowing for easier statistical inference.</li>
      <li>When <b>sample size</b> \( n \) is large enough (usually \( n \geq 30 \)) and both \( n\beta \geq 15 \) and \( n(1-\beta) \geq 15 \) hold, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion will follow a normal distribution.</li>
      <li>To improve accuracy, <b>confidence intervals</b> and <b>hypothesis tests</b> can be applied to sample proportions, leveraging the normality assumption from the CLT.</li>
