description: Learn how to analyze relationships between variables using correlation techniques like contingency tables and scatter plots, based on whether your data is categorical or quantitative.

Understanding how two variables relate is a core step in data analysis — and that's where **correlation** comes in.

But choosing the right correlation method depends on your data type: are your variables **categorical** or **quantitative**? In this post, we’ll break down the key approaches — from contingency tables to scatter plots — so you can analyze relationships with confidence.

## 🎓 Real-Life Case: Study Habits and Exam Performance

Imagine a high school counselor wants to investigate the relationship between **how often students study** and whether they **pass or fail a weekly quiz**.

She surveys 30 students and records two things:
- 📚 Study Time Category: Rarely, Sometimes, Often
- ✅ Quiz Result: Pass or Fail

---

## 🧮 Step 1: The Contingency Table

This type of table is used for **categorical variables**. It shows how often combinations of categories occur.

| Study Frequency \ Quiz Result | Pass | Fail | Total |
|-------------------------------|------|------|-------|
| Rarely                        | 3    | 7    | 10    |
| Sometimes                     | 6    | 4    | 10    |
| Often                         | 9    | 1    | 10    |
| **Total**                     | 18   | 12   | 30    |

---

## 🔁 Step 2: Conditional Proportions

The raw counts don't tell the full story. So we calculate the **percentage** of each outcome within each group.

For example:
- Among students who study **Rarely**, 3/10 passed = **30%**
- Among those who study **Often**, 9/10 passed = **90%**

| Study Frequency | % Passed | % Failed |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Rarely          | 30%      | 70%      |
| Sometimes       | 60%      | 40%      |
| Often           | 90%      | 10%      |

✅ These are **conditional proportions** — percentages **within each row**.

---

## 📊 Step 3: Understanding Proportions — Quick Summary

We use **conditional proportions** to look *within groups*, and **marginal proportions** to summarize a variable *on its own*.

- Conditional example:  
  Among those who study Rarely → 3/10 passed = **30%**
- Marginal example:  
  Overall pass rate → 18/30 = **60%**

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Interpreting the Categorical Correlation

The more a student studies, the more likely they are to pass.  
We can see a **positive association** in the conditional proportions:
- Rarely study → low pass rate
- Often study → high pass rate

➡️ But contingency tables don’t **quantify** correlation — they only show patterns.

---

## 🔄 Step 5: Let’s Make It Quantitative

Now let’s **change the scenario**:

The counselor asks students for their **exact number of study hours per week** and records their **quiz scores out of 100**.

Here’s a sample:

| Hours Studied | Quiz Score |
|---------------|------------|
| 2             | 50         |
| 3             | 55         |
| 5             | 65         |
| 7             | 70         |
| 8             | 76         |
| 10            | 85         |
| 12            | 92         |

---

## 📈 Step 6: Scatter Plot

This type of plot is perfect for **quantitative variables**.  
It helps us visually assess correlation:

- Each point = one student  
- X-axis: Hours studied  
- Y-axis: Quiz score

You’ll notice: the more hours students study, the higher their scores.  
This is a **strong positive relationship**.

    <li><strong>Overlooking non-linear patterns</strong> — not all relationships are straight lines. Try other visuals or transformations.</li>
    <li><strong>Using the wrong chart</strong> — don’t use a scatter plot for categorical data; use a contingency table instead.</li>

## 🤖 Why It Matters in Machine Learning

In machine learning, understanding **relationships between variables** helps you:

- 📊 Choose the right features for your model (feature selection).
- 📉 Detect multicollinearity — too much correlation between features can hurt model accuracy.
- 🧪 Engineer new features based on strong associations (e.g., combining study time and pass rate).
- 📈 Pick the right models — strong linear correlation? Consider regression. Categorical outcomes? Try classification.

Learning how to interpret contingency tables and scatter plots builds your **EDA skills**, a core part of every data science pipeline.

| Categorical (Nominal/Ordinal) | Contingency Table     | Study Frequency vs Pass/Fail |
| Quantitative         | Scatter Plot          | Hours Studied vs Quiz Score |

🧠 Choose the right tool based on your variable types.
