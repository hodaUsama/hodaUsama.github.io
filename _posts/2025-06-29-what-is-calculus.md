Functions are the foundation of calculus and the language of data science and machine learning. In this lesson, you'll learn what a function is, the different types of functions, and how to avoid common mistakes when starting out.

## üéØ <span style="color:#1E90FF;">What is a Function</span>

A **function** is a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. <br>
**Domain**: All possible inputs. <br>
**Range** (or **Codomain**): All possible outputs.

## üìä Types of Functions

### 1. üß†Scalar-Valued Functions

A <strong>scalar-valued function</strong> outputs a single value (a scalar).

- **Single Variable:** $f(x) = 2x + 1$
  **Example:** $f(4) = 2 \times 4 + 1 = 9$
- **Multivariate (Multiple Inputs):** $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$
  <br>Example: $f(1, 2) = 1^2 + 2^2 = 5$

    </em>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### 2. üìèVector-Valued Functions

A <strong>vector-valued function</strong> outputs a vector (more than one value).

- <b>Example:</b> $\vec{f}(x) = (x, x^2)$ <br>
  If $x = 3$, then $\vec{f}(3) = (3, 9)$
- <b>Multivariate Vector Function:</b> $\vec{g}(x, y) = (x + y, x - y)$ <br>
  If $x=2, y=1$, then $\vec{g}(2,1) = (3, 1)$

    <strong> üîÅ Real-World Example in Machine Learning:</strong><br>
    A function can represent a model that predicts house prices:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Input (Domain):</b> Features (size, location, rooms, etc.)</li>
      <li><b>Output (Range):</b> Predicted price (scalar) or probabilities (vector)</li>

### ü§ñ Real-World ML Example: Functions in Machine Learning

<div class="blog-callout blog-callout-info">
   <div>
    <strong>How are functions used in machine learning?</strong><br>
    In machine learning, almost every model is built on the concept of a <b>function</b>: a rule that maps input features to output predictions.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Linear Regression:</b> The model is a function: $f(x) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + ... + w_n x_n + b$ ‚Äî it takes inputs (features) and returns a single output (prediction).</li>
      <li><b>Neural Networks:</b> Each layer is a function, often taking a vector as input and producing another vector as output. Stacking these gives you a <b>composition of functions</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Activation Functions:</b> Functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh transform data inside neural networks, controlling nonlinearity and output range.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Key Point:</b> When you train a model, you are finding the <strong>best function</strong> (from many possible) to map your data to accurate predictions!

  <summary class="level-up-title"><strong>üöÄ Level Up</strong></summary>
  <div class="level-up-content">
    <ul>
      <li>Start looking at <strong>function composition</strong>: combining functions lets you build more complex models, just like stacking layers in a neural network.</li>
      <li>Explore <strong>inverse functions</strong>: useful for undoing operations and solving equations ‚Äî important for feature scaling in ML.</li>
      <li>Learn to spot <strong>linear vs. non-linear functions</strong>; this distinction is key in understanding why some models are simple and others capture complex patterns.</li>
      <li>Check out <strong>piecewise functions</strong>: they behave differently in different input ranges (think activation functions like ReLU in deep learning).</li>
      <li>Get familiar with <strong>parameterized functions</strong> (like $f(x; \theta)$): these are everywhere in statistics and machine learning models.</li>

<summary>üß© Is \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) a scalar-valued or vector-valued function?</summary>
It's a <b>scalar-valued function</b> ‚Äî for any input \( x \), it produces a single number.

\[
f(1,2) = 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5

</details>

<details>
<summary>üß© True or False: A function can have two different outputs for the same input.</summary>
<b>False.</b> By definition, a function assigns exactly one output for each input in its domain.

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Function** | A rule that maps each input (from the domain) to one output (in the range) |
| **Domain** | The set of all possible input values for a function |
| **Range / Codomain** | The set of all possible outputs a function can produce |
| **Scalar-Valued Function** | A function whose output is a single number (scalar) |
| **Vector-Valued Function** | A function whose output is a vector (multiple numbers) |
| **Univariate Function** | A function with a single input variable (e.g., \( f(x) \)) |
| **Multivariate Function** | A function with two or more input variables (e.g., \( f(x, y) \)) |
| **Example** | \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) is a multivariate, scalar-valued function |

Mastering these basics will help you tackle calculus concepts like **derivatives**, **gradients**, and more advanced machine learning models in future lessons!
