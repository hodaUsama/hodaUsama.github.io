Sometimes the best way to learn is to walk through a full example — one that applies **everything we've learned** so far.

## 🎓 Real-Life Scenario

Imagine you're a school data analyst. A math teacher gives you the scores from a recent **algebra quiz** taken by 10 high school students.

The teacher wants to know:
- Are these scores typical?
- Are there any unusually high or low performers?
- What is the best way to summarize this small dataset?

## 🧾 <span style="color:#1E90FF;">The Data</span>

The scores (out of 100):

\[
[44, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, 90, 95]
\]

---

## 🔍 <span style="color:#228B22;">Step 1: Type of Variable</span>

These are **quantitative** values — actual test scores.  
Since there are only 10 observations, we can visualize them easily.

---

## 📊 <span style="color:#20B2AA;">Step 2: Dot Plot</span>

Here’s what the scores look like when placed on a dot plot:

![Dot Plot of Test Scores](/assets/images/dot_plot_scores.png)

Two students (scoring 90 and 95) seem to have performed far better than the rest — possible **outliers**.

---

## 📈 <span style="color:#FF8C00;">Step 3: Measuring the Center</span>

To summarize where most students scored:

- **Mode**: None (all values are unique)
- **Median**: Middle two scores = \( (52 + 53) / 2 = 52.5 \)
- **Mean**:  
\\[
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n} = \frac{593}{10} = 59.3
\\]

🔍 Because two students scored much higher than the rest, the **mean is pulled upward**, and the **median gives a more typical score**.

---

## 📐 <span style="color:#FFA500;">Step 4: How Spread Out Are the Scores?</span>

Let’s measure variability to see if most students were close to the average.

- **Range** = 95 − 44 = **51**
- **IQR**:
  - Q1 = 49, Q3 = 57 → IQR = 8
- **Standard Deviation** (rounded):  
\\[
\sigma \approx 17.0
\\]

➡️ This tells us there’s **a wide spread**, especially due to the top scorers.

---

## 📦 <span style="color:#9370DB;">Step 5: Visualizing Spread with a Box Plot</span>

Box plots are great when you want to see:
- Center
- Spread
- Outliers — all at once

Here’s what it looks like for these scores:

![Box Plot of Test Scores](/assets/images/box_plot_scores.png)

You can clearly see the outliers to the far right.

---

## 🧮 <span style="color:#1E90FF;">Step 6: Z-Score for the Top Student</span>

Let’s calculate how far the **score of 90** is from the average:

\\[
z = \frac{90 - 59.3}{17.0} \approx 1.8
\\]

🟢 A z-score of **1.8** means this student scored **1.8 standard deviations above the mean** — a strong performance.

  <div class="mt-2">
    <p>This example highlights important concepts in real-world data analysis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📉 <strong>Outliers</strong> can dramatically affect the mean but have less influence on the median and IQR.</li>
      <li>📦 <strong>Box plots</strong> visually summarize both center and spread, making it easy to spot unusual values.</li>
      <li>🧮 <strong>Z-scores</strong> quantify how far points deviate from the mean, helping identify exceptional cases objectively.</li>
      <li>🔎 Combining these tools provides a holistic understanding of data distribution, crucial for accurate analysis and decision making.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mastering these interpretations will improve your data intuition and prepare you for advanced statistical techniques.</p>

## 🧠 <span style="color:#20B2AA;">Summary Interpretation</span>

The teacher’s intuition was right:  
Most students scored between 44–57, but **two students** (90, 95) scored **exceptionally high**, pulling the mean up.

The **median and IQR** give a better picture of the typical student’s performance, while the **box plot and z-scores** confirm the presence and magnitude of outliers.

Next time, we’ll begin our journey into **probability** — the language of uncertainty and how it powers statistical thinking.
