Before we jump into how data spreads, let’s understand how to find the **center** of it.

## 🎯 <span style="color:#1E90FF;">What is Central Tendency?</span>

Central tendency describes the **"middle" or typical value** in a dataset. The three main measures are:

- <strong style="color:#FF6347;">Mode</strong>
- <strong style="color:#FFA500;">Median</strong>
- <strong style="color:#228B22;">Mean</strong>

Each one tells us something slightly different.

---

## 🧮 <span style="color:#FF6347;">Mode</span>

- The **most frequent value** in a dataset  
- Works with **any type of variable**  
- Especially useful for **nominal (categorical)** data

💡 Example:  
If most students choose “Math” as their favorite subject, then:  
> Mode = "Math"

🛑 You can't calculate a **mean** or **median** for categories like “Math” or “History” — but you can find the mode.

---

## 🧭 <span style="color:#FFA500;">Median</span>

- The **middle value** when data is sorted  
- Best used when data is **skewed or has outliers**  
- Only works with **ordinal, interval, or ratio** variables

💡 Example:  
For ages: [16, 17, 18, 40, 90]  
> Median = 18

✅ Median is **not affected by extreme values** — that's why it's preferred when there are outliers.

---

## ➕ <span style="color:#228B22;">Mean</span>

- The **arithmetic average**  
- Add up all values, divide by the count

\\[
\text{Mean} = \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
\\]

Where:  
- \( x_i \) = each observation  
- \( n \) = total number of observations

💡 Example:  
Scores = [80, 85, 90]  
\\[
\bar{x} = \frac{80 + 85 + 90}{3} = \frac{255}{3} = 85
\\]

🛑 Not ideal when there are **outliers** — they can distort the average.

## 🖼️ Visual Comparison

Here’s a quick visual to help you compare the three measures:

- **Mode** = Most frequent  
- **Median** = Middle value  
- **Mean** = Balances all data values

## 📌 <span style="color:#9370DB;">Choosing the Right Measure</span>

| Measurement Level | Mode | Median | Mean |
|-------------------|------|--------|------|
| Nominal           | ✅   | ❌     | ❌   |
| Ordinal           | ✅   | ✅     | ❌   |
| Interval/Ratio    | ✅   | ✅     | ✅   |

⚠️ **Outliers** = values that are much higher or lower than the rest  
👉 When outliers exist, **median** is often more reliable than mean.

## 🧠 <span style="color:#1E90FF;">Level Up: When to Use Each Measure of Center</span>

<details class="border rounded p-3 bg-light my-4">
  <summary class="fw-bold text-primary">🧠 Level Up: When and Why to Choose Mode, Median, or Mean</summary>
  <div class="mt-2">
    <p>Each measure of center has its strengths depending on the data and the question:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📌 <strong>Mode</strong> is great for identifying the most common category or value — useful in marketing, survey analysis, and categorical data.</li>
      <li>📌 <strong>Median</strong> provides a robust center when your data has outliers or is skewed — like income or house prices.</li>
      <li>📌 <strong>Mean</strong> is ideal when data is symmetrically distributed and you want to use all values — common in scientific measurements and many ML algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Knowing when to use each makes your analysis more accurate and meaningful.</p>

## 🔁 <span style="color:#1E90FF;">Summary</span>

| Measure | Best For              | Sensitive to Outliers? |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Mode    | Nominal, any variable  | ❌ No                 |
| Median  | Skewed/Ordinal data   | ❌ No                 |
| Mean    | Symmetrical data only | ✅ Yes                |

In the next post, we’ll talk about how **spread out** your data is.  
That’s called **Measures of Dispersion** — including **Range**, **Interquartile Range**, and the **Box Plot**.
