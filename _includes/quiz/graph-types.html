  <p>
    âœ… A <strong>bar chart</strong> or <strong>pie chart</strong> â€” because you're visualizing a <strong>categorical (nominal)</strong> variable.  
    <br><br>
    Each bar or slice represents the number (or percentage) of people who prefer a platform like <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>TikTok</strong>, or <strong>X (Twitter)</strong>.

  <p>
    âœ… Use a <strong>histogram</strong> â€” because screen time is <strong>quantitative</strong> and continuous.  
    <br><br>
    A histogram shows how the data is distributed across intervals (e.g., <code>0â€“2</code>, <code>2â€“4</code>, <code>4â€“6</code> hours), which helps identify patterns like clustering or skewness.
