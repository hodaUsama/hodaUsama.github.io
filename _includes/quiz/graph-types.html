  <p>
    âœ… A <strong>bar chart</strong> or <strong>pie chart</strong> â€” because youâ€™re dealing with a <strong>categorical (nominal)</strong> variable.  
    <br>Each bar (or slice) represents the count or percentage for a platform like Instagram, TikTok, or X (Twitter).

    âœ… Then use a <strong>histogram</strong> â€” because the data is <strong>quantitative</strong> and continuous.  
    <br>You can group the screen time into intervals (e.g., 0â€“2, 2â€“4 hours) and visualize the distribution.
