  <p>
    ✅ <strong>Median</strong> — because it’s resistant to extreme values like the mansion.  
    <br><br>
    The mean would be skewed upward by the $3.5M value, but the <strong>median</strong> stays closer to what most houses are actually worth.

    ✅ <strong>Mode</strong> — it identifies the most frequently occurring category.  
    <br><br>
    For example, if most people in a survey choose “Cat” as their favorite pet, then the mode is <strong>“Cat”</strong>.
