<p><strong>Q:</strong> You have two datasets:</p>

<ol>
  <li>ğŸ“¦ Dataset A: {10, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 14, 15}</li>
  <li>ğŸ“¦ Dataset B: {10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 70}</li>
</ol>

<p>Both datasets have the same **median**. Which one has a larger <strong>range</strong>, and what does that tell you?</p>

<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ğŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… <strong>Dataset B</strong> has a much larger range (70 - 10 = 60) compared to Dataset A (15 - 10 = 5).  
    <br>This tells us Dataset B has <b>more extreme values</b> â€” possibly an outlier.
  </p>
</details>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Why might the <strong>IQR</strong> be a better measure of dispersion than the range in some cases?</p>

<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ğŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… Because the IQR focuses on the <b>middle 50%</b> of the data and <b>ignores outliers</b>, making it more reliable when extreme values are present.
