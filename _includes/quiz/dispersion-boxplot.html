<p><strong>Q:</strong> Consider these two datasets:</p>

<ol>
  <li>ğŸ“¦ <strong>Dataset A:</strong> {10, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 14, 15}</li>
  <li>ğŸ“¦ <strong>Dataset B:</strong> {10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 70}</li>
</ol>

<p>Both datasets have the same <strong>median</strong>. Which one has a larger <strong>range</strong>, and what does that tell you about its spread?</p>

<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ğŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… <strong>Dataset B</strong> â€” it has a much larger range:  
    <br><code>70 - 10 = 60</code> vs <code>15 - 10 = 5</code> in Dataset A.  
    <br><br>
    This tells us that Dataset B includes a <strong>more extreme value</strong> â€” possibly an <strong>outlier</strong> â€” which greatly increases its range.

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Why might the <strong>IQR</strong> be a better measure of spread than the range in some cases?</p>

  <p>
    âœ… The <strong>Interquartile Range (IQR)</strong> measures the spread of the <strong>middle 50%</strong> of the data.  
    <br>Itâ€™s <strong>not affected by outliers</strong>, so it's a more reliable indicator of typical variability in skewed datasets.
