<p><strong>Q:</strong> You have a list of 100 product categories (like <em>Electronics</em>, <em>Clothing</em>, <em>Books</em>, etc.).</p>

<p>What type of <strong>chart</strong> and <strong>table</strong> would help you best understand the distribution of these categories?</p>

<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… Use a <strong>frequency table</strong> to count how many times each category appears,  
    and a <strong>bar chart</strong> to visualize it.  
    <br><br>
    Since this is <strong>categorical data</strong>, bar charts and frequency tables are ideal for summarizing and comparing counts.

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> What if instead you had 100 <strong>numerical values</strong> showing product prices?</p>

  <p>
    âœ… Use a <strong>frequency table with intervals</strong> (like 0â€“50, 50â€“100)  
    and a <strong>histogram</strong> to visualize the distribution.  
    <br><br>
    Since prices are <strong>continuous numerical data</strong>, histograms show how values are spread across ranges.
