<p><strong>Q:</strong> Imagine you're analyzing studentsâ€™ test scores, and a few unusually high scores raise the mean. Which measure of center gives a more accurate picture of the typical studentâ€™s performance â€” <strong>mean</strong> or <strong>median</strong>?</p>

  <p>
    âœ… <strong>Median</strong> â€” because it's resistant to outliers, unlike the mean which gets skewed.  
    The median focuses on the middle value, so a few extreme values won't distort it, making it more reliable in such cases.
