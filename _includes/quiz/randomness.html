<p><strong>Q1:</strong> What does randomness mean in statistics?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>It refers to unpredictable outcomes in the short term, but stable patterns in the long run.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> What is the range of any valid probability value?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>Between 0 and 1 (i.e., <code>0 â‰¤ P(event) â‰¤ 1</code>).</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> What is a sample space?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>

<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>They cannot both occur at the same time. So, <code>P(A âˆ© B) = 0</code>.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q5:</strong> What is the formula for relative frequency?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p><code>P(event) = event count Ã· total number of trials</code>.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q6:</strong> What is the probability of two independent events A and B both occurring?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p><code>P(A âˆ© B) = P(A) Ã— P(B)</code> â€” because they donâ€™t affect each other.</p>
