<h2 id="quiz" class="mt-5">ðŸ“Œ Try It Yourself: Normal Distribution</h2>

<p><strong>Q1:</strong> What is the normal distribution also known as?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>It is also known as the **Gaussian distribution**.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> What does the standard deviation \( \sigma \) control in a normal distribution?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>The standard deviation \( \sigma \) controls the spread of the distribution (the width of the bell curve).</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> What is the probability that a value \( x \) lies between \( \mu - 3\sigma \) and \( \mu + 3\sigma \) in any normal distribution?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>99.7% of values lie between \( \mu - 3\sigma \) and \( \mu + 3\sigma \).</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q4:</strong> What percentage of values lie between \( \mu - 2\sigma \) and \( \mu + 2\sigma \)?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>95% of values lie between \( \mu - 2\sigma \) and \( \mu + 2\sigma \).</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q5:</strong> What is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) used for in the normal distribution?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>The CDF is used to calculate the probability that a random variable \( X \) falls within a specific range.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q6:</strong> In a normal distribution, how much of the distribution falls within one standard deviation of the mean?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>68% of the distribution lies between \( \mu - \sigma \) and \( \mu + \sigma \).</p>
</details>
