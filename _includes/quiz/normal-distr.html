<h2 id="quiz" class="mt-5">ðŸ“Œ Try It Yourself: Normal Distribution</h2>

<p><strong>Q1:</strong> What is the normal distribution also called?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… Itâ€™s also known as the <strong>Gaussian distribution</strong>.  
    <br><br>
    Named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who helped develop the mathematical theory behind it.

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> What does the standard deviation \( \sigma \) control in a normal distribution?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… It controls the <strong>spread</strong> (width) of the bell curve.  
    <br><br>
    A larger \( \sigma \) means a wider curve; a smaller \( \sigma \) results in a tighter, narrower shape.

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> What percentage of values fall between \( \mu - 3\sigma \) and \( \mu + 3\sigma \)?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… Approximately <strong>99.7%</strong> of values fall within this range.  
    <br><br>
    This is part of the <strong>Empirical Rule</strong> for normal distributions.
  </p>
</details>

<hr class="my-4">

<p><strong>Q4:</strong> How about the range \( \mu - 2\sigma \) to \( \mu + 2\sigma \)?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… Around <strong>95%</strong> of values fall in this range.  
    <br><br>
    This is commonly used for confidence intervals in statistics.
  </p>
</details>

<hr class="my-4">

<p><strong>Q5:</strong> What does the cumulative distribution function (CDF) tell us?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… The <strong>CDF</strong> gives the probability that a random variable is <strong>less than or equal to a certain value</strong>.  
    <br><br>
    It's useful for computing probabilities over ranges instead of exact points.
  </p>

<hr class="my-4">

<p><strong>Q6:</strong> How much of the distribution lies within one standard deviation from the mean?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… About <strong>68%</strong> of the data lies between \( \mu - \sigma \) and \( \mu + \sigma \).  
    <br><br>
    This forms the central region of the normal curve.
