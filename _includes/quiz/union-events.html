<p><strong>Q1:</strong> If events A and B are <em>disjoint</em>, what is <code>P(A âˆª B)</code>?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p><code>P(A âˆª B) = P(A) + P(B)</code> â€” because disjoint events canâ€™t happen together, so thereâ€™s no overlap to subtract.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> In a contingency table, how do you calculate a <em>joint probability</em>?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>Divide the frequency in a single cell by the total sample size.  
    <br><code>P(A âˆ© B) = count in cell / grand total</code></p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> What are <em>marginal probabilities</em> and where do you find them?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>Theyâ€™re totals across rows or columns in a table, divided by the grand total.  
    <br>They show the overall probability of a single variable.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q4:</strong> Whatâ€™s the formula for <em>conditional probability</em>?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p><code>P(A | B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B)</code> â€” itâ€™s the probability of A <em>given</em> B has occurred.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q5:</strong> Why canâ€™t marginal probabilities alone determine joint probabilities?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>Because they donâ€™t show how two variables interact â€” they only describe each variable separately.  
    <br>You need joint or conditional data to understand overlap.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q6:</strong> You know that 90% of cat owners like coffee. What kind of probability is that?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>Itâ€™s a <strong>conditional probability</strong>: the chance of liking coffee <em>given</em> that someone owns a cat.</p>
