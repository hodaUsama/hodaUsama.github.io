<p><strong>Q1:</strong> What does a <em>residual</em> represent in a linear regression model?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>âœ… <strong>Answer:</strong> The <strong>vertical distance</strong> between an actual data point and the predicted value on the regression line.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> Why do we minimize the <em>sum of squared residuals (SSR)</em> instead of just summing the residuals directly?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>âœ… <strong>Answer:</strong> Because positive and negative residuals would cancel each other out. Squaring them avoids this and emphasizes larger errors.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> In the equation \( \hat{y} = a + bx \), what does the <strong>slope</strong> \( b \) represent?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>âœ… <strong>Answer:</strong> It represents the **expected change in \( y \)** for every 1-unit increase in \( x \).</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q4:</strong> What does the \( R^2 \) value (coefficient of determination) tell us about a regression model?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>âœ… <strong>Answer:</strong> It tells us what percentage of the variance in the dependent variable \( y \) is explained by the independent variable \( x \).</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q5:</strong> Which of the following statements is true about correlation and causation?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>âœ… <strong>Answer:</strong> <strong>Correlation does not imply causation.</strong> Just because two variables move together doesnâ€™t mean one causes the other.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> You build a model to predict house prices, and the slope of your regression line is <strong>50,000</strong>. What does this mean?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>âœ… <strong>Answer:</strong> For every 1-unit increase in the input variable (e.g., number of rooms), the predicted house price increases by $50,000.</p>
