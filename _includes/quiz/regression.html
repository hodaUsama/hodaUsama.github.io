<p><strong>Q1:</strong> What does a residual represent in regression analysis?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>The <strong>vertical distance</strong> between a data point and the regression line.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> Why do we minimize the sum of squared residuals instead of summing residuals directly?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>Because positive and negative residuals would cancel each other out if summed directly.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> What does the slope (\(b\)) in the regression equation \( \hat{y} = a + bx \) represent?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>The <strong>change in \( y \)</strong> for each one unit increase in \( x \).</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q4:</strong> What does \( R^2 \) (coefficient of determination) indicate?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>How much of the <strong>variance in \( y \)</strong> is explained by the independent variable \( x \) through the regression line.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q5:</strong> Which statement is TRUE about correlation and causation?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>Correlation does not imply causation.</strong> A strong relationship does not mean one variable causes the other.</p>
