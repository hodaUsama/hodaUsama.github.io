<p><strong>Q1:</strong> What are the mean and standard deviation of the standard normal (Z) distribution?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>Mean \( \mu = 0 \) and standard deviation \( \sigma = 1 \).</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> How do you convert a raw score \( X \) to a Z-score?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>\( Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \)</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> What does the cumulative Z-table tell you?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>It gives the probability that the Z-score is less than or equal to a given value (area to the left of that Z).</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q4:</strong> How do you find the probability that \( X \) lies between two values?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>Convert both values to Z-scores, find their cumulative probabilities from the Z-table, and subtract the smaller from the larger.</p>
</details>

<p><strong>Q5:</strong> What is the approximate probability that \( Z \) lies between -1 and 1?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>About 68% (using the empirical rule).</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> How are Z-scores used in machine learning pipelines?</p>
<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… Z-scores standardize features, making them have mean = 0 and std dev = 1 â€” essential for many ML models like SVM, KNN, and logistic regression.
