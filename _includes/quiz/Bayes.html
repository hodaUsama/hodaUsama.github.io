<p><strong>Q1:</strong> If \( P(A \mid B) = P(A) \), what does this imply?</p>

<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>💡 Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    ✅ <strong>Independence</strong> — it means that knowing B occurred does not change the probability of A.  
    <br><br>
    So A and B are <strong>independent</strong> events.

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> Can disjoint events be independent?</p>

<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>💡 Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    ❌ <strong>No</strong> — disjoint events cannot both happen together, so the occurrence of one means the other definitely didn’t happen.  
    <br><br>
    That makes them <strong>dependent</strong> by definition.

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> What is the formula for <strong>Bayes’ Theorem</strong>?</p>

<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>💡 Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    ✅ <strong>Bayes’ Rule:</strong>  
    <br><br>
    <code>P(A | B) = [P(B | A) × P(A)] ÷ P(B)</code>  
    <br><br>
    It allows us to reverse conditional probabilities based on observed evidence.

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Why is Bayes’ Rule so powerful in real-world applications?</p>

<details class="my-2">
  <summary><strong>💡 Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    ✅ It helps update probabilities when new evidence appears.  
    <br><br>
    Whether in <strong>medical tests</strong>, <strong>spam filters</strong>, or <strong>AI predictions</strong>, Bayes’ Rule allows smart decision-making based on prior knowledge.
