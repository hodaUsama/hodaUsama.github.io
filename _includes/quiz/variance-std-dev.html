<p><strong>Q:</strong> Two classes take the same math quiz. The average score in both classes is <strong>75</strong>.</p>

<p>
In <strong>Class A</strong>, most students score between 70 and 80.  
In <strong>Class B</strong>, scores range widely â€” from 40 to 100.
</p>

<p>Which class has a <strong>higher standard deviation</strong>, and what does that tell us?</p>

<details class="my-2">

  <p>
    âœ… <strong>Class B</strong> â€” because its scores are much more spread out from the mean.  
    <br><br>
    A <strong>higher standard deviation</strong> means the scores are <b>less consistent</b> and show greater variability.

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Whatâ€™s the key difference between <strong>variance</strong> and <strong>standard deviation</strong>?</p>

  <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Show Answer</strong></summary>
  <p>
    âœ… <strong>Variance</strong> is the average of squared differences from the mean.  
    <br><strong>Standard deviation</strong> is the square root of variance â€” it brings the result back to the <b>original unit</b>, making it easier to interpret.
