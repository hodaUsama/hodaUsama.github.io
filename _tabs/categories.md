# Problem-Solving Pattern (Framework)

This is a flexible problem-solving pattern or framework you can adapt to different data structure problems. Make it a generalizable method.

## Problem-Solving Framework Phases:

### 1. Understand the Problem:

- **Read the problem statement carefully.**
- What are the input/output constraints? Is it large data, real-time, etc.?
- What operations must we support (searching, insertion, deletion)?
- Clarify edge cases and special conditions (Consider scenarios like empty inputs, maximum values, or repeated elements that might affect the solution).

### 2. Choose the Right Structure:

- Identify whether the problem involves:
  - Searching (e.g., finding elements)
  - Insertion/deletion (e.g., modifying the collection)
  - Traversal (e.g., visiting nodes or elements)
  - Prioritization (e.g., always accessing the smallest/largest element)
- Example: A linked list might be better than an array if frequent insertions and deletions are required.

**What are the constraints?**
- **Input size**: Large datasets may require hashing or trees for efficient processing.
- **Real-time requirements**: For fast lookups, consider hash tables or binary search trees.

### 3. Design Operations:

For each operation, think through its implementation:

#### Insertion:
- Where to Insert? (At the start, middle, or end?)
- Does the data structure allow duplicates?
- Does it need to maintain order or priority?

#### Deletion:
- What to Delete? (A specific value? A specific index?)
- Does it require removing duplicates or only the first occurrence?

#### Searching:
- What to Search For? (A value, a key, or an index?)

#### Traversal:
- What Order? (Linear, Hierarchical)

### 4. Evaluate Time and Space Complexities:

Once the operations are designed:
- **Time Complexity**: Analyze how the operation scales with the size of the data.
- **Space Complexity**: Consider auxiliary space requirements for temporary storage or recursive calls.

### 5. Refactor and Optimize:

- **Code Readability and Maintainability**: Optimize for performance (e.g., replace brute-force solutions with more efficient algorithms).
- **Test Edge Cases**: Empty data, large input, sorted/unsorted data.

### 6. Iterate Based on Feedback:

- **Iterative Problem-Solving**: Encourage modification based on new insights or requirements.

### 7. Review the Solution:

- **Verify Correctness**: Ensure the solution works for all test cases, including edge cases.
- **Efficiency**: Evaluate time complexity, space complexity, and scalability.

By systematically considering these aspects, you can ensure that each operation is designed efficiently for the chosen data structure.
