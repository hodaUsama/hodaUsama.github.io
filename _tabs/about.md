### Double Hashing Sorting Algorithm  
**Publication:** Computing in Science and Engineering (IEEE)  
**Impact Factor:** 1.7  
**Date:** July 1, 2016  

ðŸ“„ <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7878956">Read the paper</a>

A double hashing methodology first collects statistics about element distribution and then maps between elements of the array and indexes based on the knowledge collected during the first hashing.

### Mapping Sorting Algorithm  
**Conference:** SAI Computing Conference 2016, London, U.K  
**Date:** July 1, 2016  

ðŸ“„ <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7556025">Read the paper</a>

The mapping will be between elements of an array and indexes without using any comparisons and swapping. The paper analyzes the time complexity of the proposed algorithm mathematically and empirically. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(xlogm) + O(n), where n represents the number of sorted elements and m, x << n. Results show that the performance of the mapping sorting algorithm is better than or almost equal to quick sorting.
